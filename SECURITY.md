# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security is very important to us.

If you have discovered a security issue, please contact jaideepch@outlook.com directly. Please refrain from directly creating a GitHub issue and publicly disclosing the vulnerability.
We prefer a Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) to properly understand and fix the root cause problem.

Your report should include:

- Product version ([GitHub](https://github.com/jaideep25/videolify/commits/master) commit hash or [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/videolify/p2p) sha256 digest hash)
- The affected component if possible (client.js, server.js, etc.)
- A vulnerability description
- Reproduction steps

A member of the security team will confirm the vulnerability, determine its impact, and develop a fix.
The fix will be applied to the master branch, tested, and packaged in the next security release.

Thanks in advance for your support to make our products safer!
